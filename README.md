# Twitter Sentiment Analysis - Preprocessing and Feature Extraction This project applies the steps of text data preprocessing 
and feature extraction using the Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dataset. The goal is to prepare tweets for sentiment analysis by 
processing raw data into cleaned text and extracting meaningful features that can be used in machine learning models.
## Project Stages ### 1. Data Preparation #### 1.1 Uploading Data - Load tweets data from a CSV file.
- Ensure each tweet has an associated sentiment tag: positive, negative, or neutral. #### 1.2 Data Review
- - Display a sample of the data and examine the distribution of sentiment tags (positive, negative, neutral).
### 2. Text Preprocessing This section focuses on normalizing and cleaning textual data to prepare tweets for analysis and feature extraction
#### 2.1 Text Normalization - **Convert to Lowercase**: Convert all text to lowercase to treat words like "good" and "Good" as the same. 
- **Remove Punctuation**: Remove all punctuation marks (e.g., "!", ".", etc.) to clean the text. -
-  **Expand Contractions**: Expand contractions (e.g., "I'm" → "I am", "don't" → "do not"). #### 2.2 Additional Cleaning -
  **Remove Special Characters**: Remove special characters like URLs, @, #, and unnecessary symbols. -
  **Convert Accented Characters to Simple Letters**: Convert accented characters (e.g., "café" → "cafe").
*Tokenization**: - Tokenize sentences when necessary (e.g., for long tweets with multiple sentences). - Tokenize words: Break tweets into individual words
. ### 3. Feature Extraction After preprocessing the text, extract meaningful features for analysis. #### 3.1 Traditional Methods - **Bag of Words (BoW)**:
 Use the BoW method to create a matrix showing the frequency of each word in the tweets
- **TF-IDF**: Calculate the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to weigh words based on importance. #### 3.2 Word Embeddings -
-  **Word2Vec**: Use Word2Vec to create word vectors that capture the semantic meaning of words. -
- **GloVe**: Use pre-trained GloVe models to analyze word semantics and compare with BoW and TF-IDF.
  ### 4. Additional Analyses #### 4.1 Statistical or Visual Comparison - Visualize and compare the frequency distribution of words before and after preprocessing using bar graphs or histograms.
- Compare the BoW and TF-IDF scores before and after preprocessing steps. #### 4.2 Calculating Textual Similarities - Calculate the similarity between feature vectors of different
-  versions of the data (before and after preprocessing) using methods like Cosine Similarity or Jaccard Similarity. - Analyze the impact of each preprocessing step on the results.
-  ## Technical Requirements - Pandas and NumPy for data management. - NLTK and Scikit-learn for preprocessing and BoW. - SpaCy for tokenization. - Gensim for Word2Vec and TF-IDF.
